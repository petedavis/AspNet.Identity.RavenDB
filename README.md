AspNet.Identity.RavenDB
================

Fully asynchronous, new and sweet ASP.NET Identity implementation for RavenDB.

## Getting Started with Version 2.0.0
Using ASP.NET Identity RavenDB port is pretty straight forward. You can install the [AspNet.Identity.RavenDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNet.Identity.RavenDB) library through [NuGet](https://nuget.org). For now, the **AspNet.Identity.RavenDB** package which 
targets the ASP.NET Identity 2.0.0 release is pre-release. So, be sure to use the `-pre` switch while getting it through NuGet:

    Install-Package AspNet.Identity.RavenDB -Pre

The following code snippet shows the easiest way to stand up the `UserManager<TUser>` class with `IdentityUserStore<TUser>`:

    IDocumentStore documentStore = new DocumentStore
    {
        Url = "http://localhost:8080",
        DefaultDatabase = "AspNetIdentity"
    }.Initialize();

    using (IAsyncDocumentSession session = documentStore.OpenAsyncSession())
    {
        session.Advanced.UseOptimisticConcurrency = true;
        IdentityUserStore<IdentityUser> IdentityUserStore = new IdentityUserStore<IdentityUser>(session);
        UserManager<IdentityUser> userManager = new UserManager<IdentityUser>(IdentityUserStore);

        // UserManager<IdentityUser> is ready to use!
    }

Couple of things to note here:

 - You MUST set the `UseOptimisticConcurrency` flag to `true` on the `IAsyncDocumentSession` as shown above 
and leave it enabled till the end of the `IAsyncDocumentSession` lifetime because we need to ensure the uniqueness 
of the username and the email. `IdentityUserStore<TUser>` checks if you enabled optimistic concurrency or not on its constructor. If you didn't, 
it will throw an exception. However, optimistic concurrency can be disabled any time during the `IAsyncDocumentSession` 
lifetime by the session provider. That's why the library cannot possibly be sure to warn 100% of the time. So, it is extremely important to 
obey this rule and leave the optimistic concurrency enabled on the session till the end of its lifetime. Otherwise, you will have a chance of 
ending up overriding an existing user's data if a new user tries to register with the username of that existing user (which would be chaotic for you)!

 - You don't need to use `IdentityUser` entity type. However, your custom entity class must be derived from `IdentityUser` class.
